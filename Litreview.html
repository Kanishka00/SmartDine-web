              Research consistently shows that high service quality and customer satisfaction enhance firm profitability, boost staff productivity, and reduce costs. In the context of restaurants, customer satisfaction is often measured through various dimensions, including food quality, service quality, ambiance, price fairness, and convenience.<br><br>

              While traditional approaches to measuring customer satisfaction have mainly relied on qualitative or quantitative data gathered through questionnaires, there has been limited research on analyzing customer satisfaction using computer vision technologies. To a lesser extent, the importance of employing computer vision technologies in understanding customer behavior has been explored in some studies. For instance, researchers have explored customer interest by tracking head pose and facial expressions. These studies demonstrate that computer vision technologies, such as those proposed in SmartDine, can provide real-time, objective data on customer satisfaction, which is often difficult to capture through traditional methods. This approach offers a deeper and more precise understanding of customer experiences in the restaurant setting.<br><br>
              
              Operational efficiency is critical for maintaining customer satisfaction and ensuring the smooth functioning of restaurant operations. Various studies have examined strategies to enhance operational efficiency, particularly focusing on reducing customer wait times and optimizing resource utilization. Significant research has explored strategies to reduce customer wait times by optimizing table turnover. This research emphasized the importance of efficient table management in enhancing customer satisfaction and increasing overall restaurant throughput. However, these earlier works did not fully explore the potential of leveraging advanced technologies, such as data analytics or computer vision, to address these operational challenges.<br><br>
              
              In addition to table management, predictive analytics has emerged as a vital tool for improving operational efficiency in restaurants. Some studies introduced a novel approach for predicting future sales of menu items in restaurants using Bayesian generalized additive models. The findings indicated that this approach often yielded accurate and robust point predictions, with certain models providing significantly more accurate prediction intervals compared to other forecasting methods. The research was thoroughly evaluated using datasets obtained from POS systems in a restaurant and a staff canteen, demonstrating the effectiveness of these models in predicting future sales. However, the current approach relies solely on POS data, which, while enhancing its universal applicability, may limit prediction accuracy. Future work could improve model accuracy by incorporating additional data sources, such as special events, holidays, and expert insights from restaurant managers.<br><br>
              
              Moreover, labor demand forecasting, which is crucial for operational efficiency, has been explored in the context of various industries. A study focused on construction projects presents the development of advanced labor demand forecasting models, utilizing data from multiple projects to create models for total project labor and key trades. The models, based on multiple linear regression, account for factors like construction cost, project complexity, site conditions, and project type.<br><br>
              
              The methodology, validated through tests on out-of-sample projects, proved robust and reliable, aiding in human resources planning and budgeting. Although this research was centered on the construction industry, the principles of accurate labor forecasting are directly applicable to the restaurant industry. Accurate labor forecasting is vital for managing labor costs, ensuring optimal staffing levels, and ultimately contributing to operational efficiency. While the study focuses on forecasting labor costs based on overall designations, it does not provide predictions for specific employment types, such as part-time or full-time workers. Nonetheless, the approach can be adapted to the restaurant industry to forecast labor demand and improve operational efficiency.<br><br>
              
              By integrating these parameters into the SmartDine system, the project aims to provide a holistic solution that not only measures but also actively enhances both customer satisfaction and operational efficiency through real-time analysis. This innovative approach marks a significant advancement in the restaurant industry, moving beyond traditional methods by leveraging the capabilities of computer vision technology.
